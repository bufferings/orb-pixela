  You can just call "pixela/increment" and "pixela/decrement" job with the following env vars
  * PIXELA_TOKEN
  * PIXELA_USERNAME
  * PIXELA_GRAPH_ID

  You can use parameter if you want to update different graphs.

  You can call "pixela/put" job with "pre-steps" to pass date and quantity through the $BASH_ENV
  * PIXELA_DATE (yyyyMMdd)
  * PIXELA_QUANTITY

  All the three jobs have "when" parameter
  so that you can choose when to execute the step if you use "pre-steps".
